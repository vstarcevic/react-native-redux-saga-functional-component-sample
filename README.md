## React Native Sample

Whenever I am starting new React or React-Native app, I'm having several difficulties:
- add typescript
- add redux-saga
- find examples how it works with functional components, or with class approach
- why it does not work?
That is why I have this starting repo.

React Native sample app which is working for windows. It has redux-saga implementation and it uses functional component.
Basic usage is

```
yarn install 
npx react-native run-windows
```

You need to have installed yarn, and windows components in order to run it. If it does not work, please install those individual components
